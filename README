USAGE

If you have to run the same program over and over with the last few arguments
always changing, you can use this command like this:

prompt myprog --arg1 -arg2 arg3 "this is arg 4"

A prompt will show up which you can exit using Ctrl-D.

You can add multiple arguments per each prompt line. Remember to encase
arguments that contain spaces using 'quotes' or "double quotes".

Lines entered into the prompt will be stored into a history name derived from
the supplied command complete with its arguments, and ending with the
.history file extension. Lines that result in errors (non-zero exit codes)
from the command will also be added to a file named the same, but which ends
in .errors instead of ending in .history.

Please set the disallowed variable depending on whether you're on Linux,
Windows, or some other operating system.
